# SimpleSite
A very easy site with db hosted content.   Design can be changed by updates to the css file

I run my site, Blissgig.com, with this code.  I designed this over a decade ago as a very simple solution for users who need the ability to add content to thier site without having to have the developer make each update.  (We've all been there)

This code does not include an interface for adding new articles.  The users can use a script in the database management application or, as I do, charge your client for those additional features.
